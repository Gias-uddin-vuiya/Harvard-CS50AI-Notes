### Search Problems

- Inital state (some place where we gegin)

- actions (some sort of action that we can take or multiple action that we can take in any given state)

- transition model (some way of defining what happens when we go from one state and make one action what state do we end up with as a result)

- goal test (In additon to that, we need some goal test to know whether or not we've reached a goal)

- path cost funciton (path cost function that tells us for any particular path by following some sequence of actions, how expensive is that path.)


The goal, ultimately, is to find a soluiton, where a solution in this case is just some sequence of actions that will take us from the initial state to a goal state.
